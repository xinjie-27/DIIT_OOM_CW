This is my group assignment project for the Object Oriented Modelling subject in Sunway College. AeroCheck is a proposed software system designed to revolutionize the airline industry by simplifying the check-in process and boarding pass issuance for passengers. User can select counter check-in or self service. For counter check-in, a dialogue box will pop up showing a random counter number. For self service, user can select individual check-in or group check-in. 
The booking number, name, ic, phone number, email, origin, destination, and seat number of both individual and group passengers are prestored using ArrayList in respective classes. After user enter a booking number, the system will check whether it matches the record in ArrayList. If found a match for the booking number, a formated boarding pass will be generated by retrieving the passenger's information from the ArrayList.
User can then select special assistance needed. After that, a dialogue box will pop up to ask user whether they want to send the boarding pass to their email.
If users purchased checked baggage, they will need to enter the baggage weight and quantity of baggage tag needed. The baggage tag will be generated using for loop.
